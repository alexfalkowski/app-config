# Application Configuration

A place for all of my application configuration

## Tags

The tag format is `application/version`  e.g `test/v1.9.0`

Please run the following:

```bash
make version=app/version release
```

So to release a version of 1.6.0 for web, it would be

```bash
make version=web/v1.6.0 release
```
